# SpaceX Prediction Model

## Introduction
SpaceX needs no introduction. I don't even know why I have this section. 

## The project
Why is SpaceX so successful? Reusable rockets. The Stage One of rockets can be reused, apparently. But only if it doesn't explode(obviously). That has happened a few times. 
So, if a company can reuse a rocket, they don't have to build a new one for the next flight (again, obviously). This saves on expenses, and we're talking about expenses in the ballpark of $100M+. So, what this means is, given the information of previous launches, we can give a vague probability of the success of the next one. This gives us a vague idea of how much the next rocket would cost. 

So, here I did a few things:
1. Collected this information from the SpaceX official API of previous launches using the Python Request library (also from webscraping their Wikipedia page using BeautifulSoup library, but that was a side project)
2. Cleaned up this data (believe it or not, this was one of the hardest part) using the Pandas library (and LOTS of patience).
3. Work in progress... 

## Side Notes:

(Don't bother reading this, I'm writing it for myself)
Over the course of this project, I learnt a LOT about a LOT. This project was pretty significant for several reasons:

1. First proper project of mine.
2. Through this project I learnt how to use Git and Github - concepts I was previously largely unfamiliar with. In fact, this repo isn't the first repo for this project made - over the course of development, I made two successive repositories before this, but deleted them both for a plethora of reasons.
3. Learnt how to use self made modules and packages. Never did that before, and my first try with it was absolutely disastrous (Deleted the second repository because of the horrendous file structuring.)
4. Finally came to use and appreciate file formatting systems, and their immense timesaving potential. 
5. Using this project as an excuse, finally structured my laptop's rat-hair organisation system.
6. To be Updated...
